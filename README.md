# GolemChad
Made for TurtyWurty's meme modding competition.

 

Allows you to turn your Iron Golems into Golem Chads by applying a nether star onto them, making them more than three times stronger, and 'chadifying' them.

 

For whatever reason needed, I've added a config file so you can disable the gigachad music song that plays when you chadify the golem, alternatively, you can make a resource pack to rename the song in the path: "assets/golemchad/sounds/chad_theme.ogg".
